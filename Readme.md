# DummyJSON to Custom API Project

## Overview

This project transforms data from DummyJSON into a custom-built REST API with enhanced features and persistent storage. It serves as a bridge between the dummy data service and a production-ready API implementation, complete with database storage and advanced querying capabilities.

## Project Goals

- Create a robust, scalable API service using Express.js
- Transform and store DummyJSON data in a local database
- Implement comprehensive CRUD operations
- Add advanced features like pagination, filtering, and search
- Provide better error handling and validation

## Features

### Data Management

- Data synchronization with DummyJSON
- Persistent storage in MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- Automated data refresh capabilities
- Data validation and sanitization

### API Endpoints

- Full CRUD operations for all resources
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Advanced filtering and sorting options
- Search functionality across multiple fields
- Bulk operations support

### Technical Features

- RESTful API design
- Request validation
- Error handling middleware
- Rate limiting
- API documentation
- Authentication (optional)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- **ODM/ORM**: Mongoose/Prisma
- **Additional Tools**:
  - Axios for HTTP requests
  - Cors for cross-origin support
  - dotenv for environment management
  - Express validator for request validation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
